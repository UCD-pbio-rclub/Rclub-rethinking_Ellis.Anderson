In light of de Finetti's statement that "PROBABILITY DOES NOT EXIST", the statement "The probability of water is .7" suggests that given our understanding of the system and our data, there is a 70% chance that the tossed globe will result in an observation of water. This is particular to our small world, and while informative of the large world, it's only a best guess which is predicated on the accuracy of our globe and the robustness of the data. We're really saying our best guess at the probability of water is that it's .7.
