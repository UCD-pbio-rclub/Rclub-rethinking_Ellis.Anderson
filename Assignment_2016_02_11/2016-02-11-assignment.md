In light of de Finetti's statement that "PROBABILITY DOES NOT EXIST", the statement "The probability of water is .7" suggests that given our understanding of the system and our data, there is a 70% chance that the tossed globe will result in an observation of water. This is particular to our small world, and while informative of the large world, it's only a best guess which is predicated on the accuracy of our globe and the robustness of the data. We're really saying our best guess at the probability of water is that it's .7.

The potential paths for the globe toss start with a fork between Mars and Earth. From there Mars has a probability of 1 for producing a land value, whereas Earth has only a probability of .3. As the result observed is land, the path to water can be ignored. The probability of Earth producing the land result (.3) is then divided by the overall unstandardized probability (1 + .3) to produce a standardized probability of .23 that the Earth globe produced the observed land result.

There are six possible "paths" for the drawing of cards prior to any cards being drawn: either side of the white card, either side of the black card, or the black or white side of the black/white card could be drawn. As a black side is certainly drawn, we know that all possibilities where white is drawn first are not possible. This removes three of six possibilities, resulting in just three remaining possibilities. One possibility is that the black/white card was pulled, another possibility (or two possibilities) is that the black card was drawn, in which case a second black side remains on the back of the card. Therefore 2 of 3 possibilities result in the backside of the card being black.
