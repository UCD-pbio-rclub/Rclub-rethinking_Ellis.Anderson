There are four ways for the first card to be black and have a second black side facing down and only one way for the first card to be black and have a white side facing down. p=4/5 

## 2M6

The White White card doesn't need to be considered. There are 2 ways to pull the W/B card for every B/B card that is pulled, but only 1 way that card can be picked and show black. There are 2 ways for the black card to be pulled and show a black face however. Multiplied out, there are 2 ways for the W/B card to be pulled and 2 ways for the B/B card to be pulled, therefore p = .5 that the back side is black.

##2M7

From the 3 initial card draw possbilities (BB BB WB) 8 more possibilities emerge, 3 from each BB card and 2 from the WB card. If a BB card is drawn, a WW WW or WB card could be drawn next. If the WB card was drawn, a WW or WW result is possible. Therefore, there are 6 of 8 which result in a black side on the back of the card.

I'd love to keep working on this but I really need to keep studying for a midterm
